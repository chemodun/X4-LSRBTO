[h1]Lost Ships Replacement - Better than Old[/h1]

In X4: Foundations, the [b]Lost Ships Replacement[/b] feature was introduced in version [b]7.50[/b].
This feature allows the fleet to request a replacement ship if a ship is lost during the execution of an order.
The replacement ship will have the same outfit/loadout as the lost ship and will be requested automatically.

But what if you want to have a better replacement ship? At least from the loadout point of view.

There is such solution - the [b]Lost Ships Replacement - Better than Old[/b] extension.

[h2][b]Compatibility[/b][/h2]

This extension is compatible with the following versions:

[h2][b]Limitations[/b][/h2]

If the shipyard selected to produce the replacement ship does not have the required resources for the better one - you will get the "old" one.
