# Lost Ships Replacement - Better than Old

In X4: Foundations, the `Lost Ships Replacement` feature was introduced in version `7.50`.
This feature allows the fleet to request a replacement ship if a ship is lost during the execution of an order.
The replacement ship will have the same outfit/loadout as the lost ship and will be requested automatically.

But what if you want to have a better replacement ship? At least from the loadout point of view.

There is such solution - the `Lost Ships Replacement - Better than Old` extension.

## Compatibility

This extension is compatible with the following versions:

- X4: Foundations version `7.50`

## Limitations

This mod is requires `Protected UI Mode` in the Extensions settings to be disabled.
If the shipyard selected to produce the replacement ship does not have the required resources for the better one - you will get the "old" one.

## Download

You can download the latest version via - [Steam client](https://steamcommunity.com/id/chemodun/myworkshopfiles/?appid=392160)
Or you can do it via [Nexus Mods](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/ChemODun/mods?gameId=2659)

## Usage

Simply install the extension and play as usual.
Only one, but important, thing - please save the required loadout for any ship model with name 'ReplacementShip' in the shipyard.
Nothing more is required.

And mod will try to provide the better replacement ship for you.
